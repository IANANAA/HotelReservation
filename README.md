# HotelReservation

In this project, my primary role was that of the main programmer. Here's a breakdown of what I worked on:

1. Data Exploration: I used Python on the Google Colab platform to explore the dataset thoroughly. This involved understanding the dataset's structure, visualizing data patterns, and gaining insights into its characteristics. The goal was to understand the data's potential and identify any initial trends or challenges.

2. Data Preprocessing: After data exploration, I focused on data preprocessing tasks. This included cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and transforming categorical variables into a suitable format for our machine learning models. I used techniques like data cleaning, encoding categorical features, and ensuring data quality.

3. Model Implementation: I implemented three different classification models: RANDOM FOREST, KNN, and SVM. These models were used to classify hotel reservations into relevant categories. I configured the models, trained them on the training dataset, and fine-tuned their hyperparameters for optimal performance.

4. Model Evaluation: After training the models, I evaluated their performance using various metrics, such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and the F1 Score. This step was essential to determine which classification method performed the best in classifying the data.

5. Result Analysis: I analyzed the results from the classification models and compared their performance. Based on the evaluation metrics, I made recommendations on which model was the most suitable for classifying hotel reservations.

Additionally, my team had other members responsible for different tasks. One of my teammates worked on creating the project website, and another team member was responsible for preparing documentation and reports, summarizing our findings and project details for reference and presentation.
